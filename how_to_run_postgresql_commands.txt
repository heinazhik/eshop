Here’s a step-by-step guide to run the SQL commands in Ubuntu 24.04 using the psql command-line tool for PostgreSQL.

Step 1: Install PostgreSQL Client (if not already installed)
If you don’t have the PostgreSQL client (psql) installed, you can install it using the following command:

bash
Copy
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql-client
Step 2: Connect to the PostgreSQL Database
Use the psql command to connect to your PostgreSQL database. Replace the placeholders with your actual database credentials:

bash
Copy
psql -h localhost -U admin -d ecommerce_db -p 5432
-h localhost: Specifies the database host.

-U admin: Specifies the database user.

-d ecommerce_db: Specifies the database name.

-p 5432: Specifies the database port.

When prompted, enter the password: admin123.

Step 3: Run the SQL Commands
Once connected to the database, you can run the SQL commands directly in the psql shell.

Add the featured column:

sql
Copy
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN featured BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
If successful, you’ll see the output:

Copy
ALTER TABLE
Update specific products to be featured:

sql
Copy
UPDATE products SET featured = TRUE WHERE product_id IN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);
If successful, you’ll see the output:

Copy
UPDATE 6
Step 4: Verify the Changes
To verify that the featured column has been added and updated correctly, run the following query:

sql
Copy
SELECT product_id, name, featured FROM products WHERE product_id IN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);
You should see the featured column with a value of TRUE for the specified products.

Step 5: Exit the psql Shell
To exit the psql shell, type:

sql
Copy
\q
Full Command-Line Workflow
Here’s the full workflow in one go:

bash
Copy
# Step 1: Connect to the database
psql -h localhost -U admin -d ecommerce_db -p 5432

# Step 2: Run the SQL commands
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN featured BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
UPDATE products SET featured = TRUE WHERE product_id IN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);

# Step 3: Verify the changes
SELECT product_id, name, featured FROM products WHERE product_id IN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);

# Step 4: Exit
\q
Optional: Run SQL Commands Directly from the Command Line
If you prefer to run the SQL commands directly from the terminal without entering the psql shell, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy
PGPASSWORD=admin123 psql -h localhost -U admin -d ecommerce_db -p 5432 -c "ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN featured BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE; UPDATE products SET featured = TRUE WHERE product_id IN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);"
Expected Output
If everything works correctly, you’ll see:

Copy
ALTER TABLE
UPDATE 6

To run the psql command as the postgres user from the command line, you can use the sudo -u postgres command to switch to the postgres user before executing the psql command. Here's how you can do it:

Step-by-Step Guide
Open the Terminal:
Launch your terminal in Ubuntu 24.04.

Run the Command as postgres User:
Use the following command to execute psql as the postgres user:

bash
Copy
sudo -u postgres psql -h localhost -U admin -d ecommerce_db -p 5432
sudo -u postgres: Switches to the postgres user.

psql -h localhost -U admin -d ecommerce_db -p 5432: Connects to the PostgreSQL database using the specified credentials.

Enter Your Password:
If prompted, enter your sudo password (your system password, not the database password).

Enter the Database Password:
When prompted, enter the database password for the admin user: admin123.

Explanation of the Command
sudo -u postgres: Runs the following command as the postgres user, which is the default superuser for PostgreSQL.

psql -h localhost -U admin -d ecommerce_db -p 5432: Connects to the PostgreSQL database with the specified credentials.

Alternative: Run SQL Commands Directly
If you want to run SQL commands directly from the command line without entering the psql shell, you can use the following:

bash
Copy
sudo -u postgres psql -h localhost -U admin -d ecommerce_db -p 5432 -c "YOUR_SQL_COMMAND"
For example, to add the featured column and update the products, you can run:

bash
Copy
sudo -u postgres psql -h localhost -U admin -d ecommerce_db -p 5432 -c "ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN featured BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE; UPDATE products SET featured = TRUE WHERE product_id IN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);"
Expected Output
If the commands are successful, you’ll see:

Copy
ALTER TABLE
UPDATE 6
Troubleshooting
Permission Denied:

Ensure you have sudo privileges on your system.

If the postgres user doesn’t have access to the psql command, check the PostgreSQL installation.

Database Connection Issues:

Verify that the database is running and accessible at localhost:5432.

Double-check the database credentials (DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME).

Password Authentication Failed:

Ensure the password for the admin user is correct.

If the password is incorrect, reset it using:

bash
Copy
sudo -u postgres psql -c "ALTER USER admin WITH PASSWORD 'admin123';"
